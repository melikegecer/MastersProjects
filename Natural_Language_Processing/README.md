# Seminar : Natural Language Processing
### Subject : Author Profiling by Age
### Motivation
In this project, I studied Author Profiling by Age Range. My aim for this project was to understand Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning better with the guidance of two papers [1] [2]. In addition, I aimed to investigate a given data set and apply Machine Learning algorithms to a data set.

[1] Schler, Jonathan, et al. “Effects of Age and Gender on Blogging.”
[2] Argamon, Shlomo, et al. “Automatically Profiling the Author of an Anonymous Text.”
