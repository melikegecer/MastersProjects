# Design and Graphics of Programming for Game Development
#### Idea
The idea of this game is to create a platformer. The player is a dragon and eliminates knights that are risking their lives to steal his treasure.
#### Theme
The scenario takes the player into a medieval fantasy world. A dragon and knights equipped with swords fight each other.
#### Tetard
##### Story
Greedy humans try to steal the dragon’s treasures. After many attacks, he is so angry that he goes after all humans to seek revenge. As the dragon burns humans, he’ll get their left belongings and collects them.
##### Mechanics
Dragon is played by the player. It cannot move forward nor backward. The only movement allowed is jumping. In addition, it can breath fire and collect gems throughout the game. In case of collecting gems, the score will increase. When it breaths outs fire, a knight is injured and finally killed. 
Knights within the game are NPCs (Non-Player Character). Basically, they walk towards to the dragon and try to attack it with their swords. On success, the dragon’s health will decrease (or eventually it will die).
A gem is a collectible item in the game. When it’s collected the score of the player will increase. Rarity of gems are subject to be implemented. For instance; when a red Gem is picked up, the score will increase by 10 points. When a yellow Gem is picked up, the score will increase by 20 points.
##### Technology
The game will be implemented with Unity. General laws of physics apply. The game is a so called auto scroller. The world moves towards the player and at one point there’s an end of the level, before the next one begins.
##### Aesthetics
The general look of this game has a medieval age look. The sounds of the game are medieval and will be heard when;
- Dragon breath outs fire
- Dragon dies
- Knight hits the dragon
- Knight dies
- Gem is picked up
- Game ended
